# Renewable-Energy-Generation-Data-Analysis
A Python-based renewable energy analysis project examining solar, wind and hydro generation trends for January 2025. Includes statistical insights, peak-day detection and clear visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to present data-driven findings.

**Renewable Energy Analysis – January 2025**

This project analyzes daily renewable energy generation from solar, wind, and hydro sources for January 2025. Using Python-based data analytics, the study uncovers key patterns, peak production days, and total energy contributions through clean visualizations and statistical summaries.

**Project Objectives**

1)Load and preprocess time-series energy data

2)Compute average generation and identify high-production days

3)Compare energy contributions across renewable sources

4)Visualize daily trends and total output

5)Present insights through clear engineering-focused analysis

**Tech Stack**

1)Python

2)Pandas – data handling

3)Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

4)CSV Dataset – daily energy records

**Key Features**

1)Statistical Overview: Mean generation for all three energy sources

2)Peak Day Detection: Finds the highest-producing days for solar, wind, and hydro

3)Trend Analysis: Line chart for daily generation patterns

4)Energy Contribution Breakdown: Pie + bar charts for total monthly output

5)Clean & Modular Code: Easy to extend for forecasting or additional sources

**Visual Outputs**

1)Daily trend line plot

2)Total contribution pie chart

3)Source-wise monthly energy bar chart

**How to Run**

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
python energy_analysis.py

**Dataset**

Contains daily renewable energy readings for January 2025, including: 1)Date

2)Solar_kWh

3)Wind_kWh

4)Hydro_kWh
